      <p id="about">Full stack developer with previous experience in retail/food service management. Excels at problem solving and working
        with others to complete given tasks. Recently earned certificate of completion from Michigan State University for Full 
        Stack Development. During the course, the MERN stack was the main focus. Excels at MongoDb, express.js, React.js and 
        node.js. For the final project, I handled the entire backend including: setting up the mongo database and setting up 
        ApolloGraphQL. I am a detail-oriented coder who has contributed to past projects by finding ways to write code more 
        efficiently. I helped classmates identify bugs in their code and was consistently approached by project teammates to double-
        check their work. Known among staff for being knowledgeable and understanding when complex problems arise. I am beyond 
        excited to begin this new stage and cannot wait to continue to develop my new technical skills.
