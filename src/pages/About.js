      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>My name is Brendan Kersey. I am a 33 year old male. I have just recently switched into the field of Full stack Web development.
        I have a background going back to highschool in programming. There I took visual basic and a web development class. Most recently I ran
        a starbucks in the Okemos area. I have just recently started a family with my wife and needed a more secure job field. Feel free to check
        out my projects by clicking the project link at the top.
